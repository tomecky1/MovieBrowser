## DEMO

[SITE PREVIEW](https://krystian22frontend.github.io/movie-browser/)

## DESCRIPTION

This is a project from Youcode programming bootcamp, still in development.

**Things to do in nearby future:**

- add loader while long loading movie details DONE
- arrow colors pagination
- clickable wgoe logo "Movie Browser" DONE
- no loader when switching pages pagination DONE
- movies active in starting page DONE
- pasting page in query does not work,
- pagination logic should be based on query params and fetching data from API on it,
- loader with movie description
- active button on selected subpage movie/people
- amount of tiles in movie cast and crew
- debounce means not to post every single letter to server
- searching specific movie in query and in input when pasting only to query
- if there is no section then we don't display movie cast albo crew
- github CoPilot to VSC
- generic hooks that repeat themselves
- reusable hooks for the future
- deleting return from a function without condition attribute
- delete react fragment if not needed
- instead of multiple states like setDate, date, minimize states usage to improve code efficiency
- 0 in styled components without "px"
- worth learning TypeScript

_Technology used in this project includes:_

- HTML 5
- CSS with BEM
- JS
- React
- React Router
- Redux Saga
- Babel
- Webpack
- Axios
- styled components

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more
information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will
remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right
into your project so you have full control over them. All the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will
point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you
shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't
customize it when you are ready for it.
